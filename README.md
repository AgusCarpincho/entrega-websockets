# CH - Entrega Websockets

## Installation

Create a directory where you want to place this project

Inside the directory open a terminal and run the command

```bash
git init
```

Next clone this repository with following command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AgusCarpincho/entrega-websockets.git
```

And finally, then install the project dependencies with your favorite package manager, in my case it is npm

```bash
npm install
```

Inside the package.json file you will find the necessary scripts to deploy the project locally

```bash
npm start
```

Deploys the project with node similar to a production environment

And

```bash
npm run dev
```

Deploys the project in development mode using nodemon which allows through hot-reload to interact with the code, modify it, etc. and instantly see the changes made in the application without having to start the project again.

By default the project is started on port http://localhost:8080

## Congratulations! now you can play with the project :)
